# My Personal Websiteüåê
Welcome to my personal website! This is a modern, fast, and responsive portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and enhanced with custom CSS and JavaScript where needed.

Here, you'll find not only information about me, but also a curated collection of other websites and projects I've built in the past. Most of these projects were developed independently, while a few were created as part of group collaborations. It's a living portfolio that showcases my growth, creativity, and technical skills across different technologies and platforms.
