            Hello, and welcome to my personal website. I am a graduate from Eastern Washington University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with minors in Communications, Cybersecurity, and Spanish. I am on track to graduate in December 2025.
        </p>
        <p class="left-text" style="margin-top: 1em;">
            During my time at Eastern, I have studied a wide range of topics including web development, software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, and data mining. I’ve also gained exposure to various other areas of computing, which has broadened my technical foundation.
        </p>
        <p class="left-text" style="margin-top: 1em;">
            I am proficient in C, Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and I am continually working to expand my skill set by exploring new tools, frameworks, and technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="left-text" style="margin-top: 1em;">
            Outside of coding, I enjoy watching YouTube, spending time with friends watching sports, and playing video games during my downtime.
        </p>
